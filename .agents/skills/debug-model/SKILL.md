  Debug silent corruption when a MAX model loads, compiles, serves, and generates
  tokens but output disagrees with a reference implementation. Use whenever parity
  debugging stalls on scalar taps, the model returns gibberish or wrong greedy
  tokens, logit cosine is high but argmax differs, or generation is coherent then
  diverges — during an architecture port, a quantization bring-up, a multi-GPU
  conversion, or after a MAX upgrade. Triggers on "parity failure", "silent
  corruption", "logits match but tokens diverge", "top-1 mismatch", "greedy
  divergence", and "model serves but generates garbage". Not for crashes on load
  or pre-serve scaffolding (use import-model). Mandates reference-vs-MAX
  tensor-dump comparators first, verify fixes numerically before recompiling, and
  serve-vs-pipeline bisect when dumps match but text diverges.
compatibility: Requires pixi env with MAX installed, network access to Hugging Face Hub, and a GPU for dumping and serving.

# Parity/coherence failure protocol

The model runs without errors but output is wrong. Scalar `ops.print` taps and
recompile loops hide directional bugs and burn GPU time. Build a per-layer
tensor-dump comparator first; every later check becomes a numpy read from disk.

**Use this skill when** MAX output disagrees with a PyTorch reference you can
run and hook. The primary case is a custom-architecture port that serves but
fails parity or coherence checks; the same protocol covers a quantized variant
of a working port, a multi-GPU conversion of a working single-GPU port, and a
regression after a MAX upgrade — anywhere a trusted reference exists.

**Do not use this skill when:**

- The server crashes on load → fix config, weights, graph (`import-model`)
- You have not finished implementing the graph → `import-model` Phase 2
- An already-verified model needs logit-comparison tolerances tuned → that is
  threshold calibration, not corruption

op logging), see

`max.nn.hooks.PrintHook` (covered in comparator-build.md) prints layer
inputs and outputs for quick triage.

## Protocol

### Step 0: Sanity-check HF

Run `model.generate(...)` on the same HF repo, prompt, and checkpoint. If HF is
incoherent, fix tokenizer/chat-template first; the MAX graph is not the problem.

```bash
pixi run python -c "
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('<repo>')
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('<repo>', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map='auto')
text = tok.apply_chat_template([{'role':'user','content':'Hello!'}], tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
out = model.generate(**tok(text, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device), max_new_tokens=32, do_sample=False)
print(tok.decode(out[0]))
"
```

### Step 1: Build the comparator

Follow [comparator-build.md](references/comparator-build.md). You need three
artifacts: HF dumper, MAX dumper (graph edits + standalone runner), comparator
script. Cast dump tensors to FP32 in the MAX graph.

> **Guard: validate the dumpers before trusting them.** Run both dumpers on a
> model MAX already serves correctly (any registered Llama works). Expect
> cos ≈ 0.999 at every layer, identical `prompt_tokens.npy` on both sides, and
> `post_embed` cos = 1.0. Anything less means the dumpers are broken — fix
> them before reading anything into a comparison on your port.

### Step 2: Read comparator output, then branch

Follow
[comparator-output-patterns.md](references/comparator-output-patterns.md). Check
false cliffs (wrong `hidden_states` indexing, missing `attention_mask` on
decode-prefix dumps) before bisecting the graph.

The first trustworthy comparator run is a fork, not a checkpoint:

- **Some layer diverges** → graph hunt; continue with Steps 3 to 5.
- **Every layer matches (cos ≥ 0.99) but generation still diverges** → the
  graph is likely correct. Skip to Step 6; do not bisect layers.
- **Pattern matches a false-cliff signature** → fix the dumper, re-dump,
  re-read. Do not debug the graph against a broken comparator.

Compute per-token and per-dim cosine slices when global cos looks ambiguous:

```python
cos_per_token = [cos(h[t], m[t]) for t in range(h.shape[0])]
cos_per_dim   = [cos(h[:,d], m[:,d]) for d in range(h.shape[1])]
```

High `max_diff` where HF spikes and MAX is flat usually means HF formed an
attention anchor your port did not, not "MAX exploding."

### Step 3: Dispatch investigation agents

Follow [agent-workflow.md](references/agent-workflow.md). One lead agent
analyzes dumps and ranks hypotheses with tensor evidence. Helpers run in
parallel (weight stats, code diff, kernel inspection, sub-tap prep). Do not
dispatch fix-attempt agents until the lead localizes.

### Step 4: Verify numerically before recompiling

For each hypothesis: read dump tensors, compute what the fix would produce,
compare to HF. Match → recompile. No match → next hypothesis.

### Step 5: Apply fix, re-dump, re-compare

One compile, one smoke, full comparator pass (cos > 0.99 all layers). If
verification still fails, see
[stacked-failures.md](references/stacked-failures.md).

### Step 6: Serve vs pipeline

When teacher-forced dumps at decode step K match HF but generated text diverges,
the graph is likely correct. Bisect before re-bisecting layers:

| Check                           | Pass                       | Fail →                                                 |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Teacher-forced dump @ K         | cos ≥ 0.99, argmax matches | Steps 1 to 5 (graph bug)                               |
| Incremental pipeline decode @ K | token K matches HF         | Decode-state bug (KV, conv cache)                      |
| Serve vs pipeline @ K           | match                      | Harness bug (tokenizer, chat template, token recovery) |

Build if missing: pipeline decode compare, incremental layer dump, serve
compare scripts. If teacher-forced and pipeline both pass but serve fails, do
not edit the graph.
